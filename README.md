# E7-Auto-Shop-Refresh
Basically what the name implies...<br>
It looks for covenant and mystic summons and then buy them<br>
I made and tested it for google play pc launcher at full screen.<br>
If anyone wants to comment on anything fell free.<br>
I can't asure you this program will pick up 100% of the summons shown on screen but I'm fairly certain it'll pick most of them.<br>
If you want 100% you should probably do it manualy. <br>
I recommend to anyone new to python to install it with the anaconda distribution and don't forget to isntall the modules.<br>
To do this open the Anaconda Promt and enter the following commands.<br>

Requires Python (python 3.10 recommended)
pip install -r requirements.txt<br>

If it isn't working very well try to make small adjustments on "confidence" values (mainly on lines 33 - 34 - 35)
And if it isn't precise enough you can take your own images instead of my default ones
